I chose to refactor the following five switch statements:
	smithy
	village
	great_hall [something broken]
	salvager [something broken]
	sea_hag
	
To refactor them all I did was take the code that each switch statement implimented and created a function that accomplished that.
Then all I did was call those functions (as voids) and passed them the variables that they needed in order to work.
I kept the return calls in their respective switch statements.
