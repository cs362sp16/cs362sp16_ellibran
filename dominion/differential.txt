After modifying my classmate's files to fit with the output scheme that I used it took a bit of time to create a difference between ours. Once it did it turned out that I had an error in my code that would occasionally buy more than the simulated players were allowed to.

It requires a very indepth look or a correct implimentation that you can compare your code against in order to verify that you are testing correctly.
