After modifying my classmate's files to fit with the output scheme that I used it took a bit of time to create a difference between ours. Once it did it turned out that I had an error in my code that would occasionally buy more than the simulated players were allowed to. This took a while to fix and was not that easy to track down, because of this I do not think that the this was an ideal case for differntial testing. It requires a very indepth look or a correct implimentation that you can compare your code against in order to verify that you are testing correctly.
My code coverage for this assignment did increase a decent amount from the previous assignments. In assignment 2 I had a code coverage of around the mid 20's, when I completed assignment 3 the coverage went up to the higher mid thirties. In this assignment my code coverage is now at 43 percent, this number seemed to increase slightly by run but not by a large margin and not consistently.
