During the creation of my unit tests I spent the majority of my time working on manipulating the makefile in a way that would make it cooperative, a feat that I am still not quite sure that I have accomplished. Once I had a Makefile that would successfully compile and output my gcov information I was able to continue past the first test unit test that I had created and begin writing the last three function unit tests. As a whole the unit tests were not as difficult as I thought they would be once I understood how to conduct unit tests in C. The biggest problems that I seemed to have with them were either syntactic or understanding what I needed to cover for the unit test to be vaguely comprehensive. 

As for my findings, I am honestly unsure. At the point that I had completed the unit tests on functions I had a test percentage of around the mid 20’s. But once I completed the card unit tests the percentage dropped to around 19, where it stayed. I don’t really know what would cause this, my best guess is that C was upset about some missed declarations earlier in my night and decided to punish me this way.
