When starting this assignment I looked into Alex's repository to see if there was a random test that I could use as a reference. Going from there, I began to modify one of the card unit tests from our previous assignment to fit a random test. Once I had a template for randomly testing a card I spent a good deal of time getting the makefile to cooperate, but once it did I was able to work out the initial kinks of the test and turn it into a correct random tester. As for breaking the code I created multiple instances of a test that would create a game of a random amount of people, assign a random person to be the tester, give them a random hand and deck size, and then finally give them the card in question and have them play it. This technique did not differ for the different random tests. Enacting random testing did make my test coverage go up from the previous assignment. At the end of the previous one I had, max, around the low to mid 20â€™s. After running the final random test of the three my test coverage had gone to 29.95%.
