Name: Failure to Discard
File: dominion.c
Function: new_mine {Lines 1171 - 1207}
Severity: Moderate, is a card that will not be discarded after use.
Priority: Moderate, it is not game breaking but is a substantial error if the player gets this card.

Description: 
There is a bug in dominion.c, specifically in the function new_mine. My unit test returned that the function never discards the trashed card.

Reproduction: 
Create a simulated game and have a player be given and use the card mine.

Fix: 
	discardCard(i, currentPlayer, state, 0);
