Name: Increment Off By Four Error
File: dominion.c
Function: card_village
Severity: Moderate, the use of this card will give the player two additional actions and not count the cards use as one.
Priority: Moderate, it is not game breaking but is a substantial error if the player gets and uses this card.

Description: 
There is a bug in dominion.c, specifically in the function card_village. My unit test returned that the function, instead of incrementing the number of actions by two, decrements it. 

Reproduction: 
Create a simulated game and have a player be given and use the village card.

Fix: 
	state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;
